# first-web-server

This boring repo is my first web server! There's not much to it, but it's a bit of a milestone marking the beginning of
what I hope will be a successful web development career. I used Sinatra, a simple Ruby file, and a couple html and text files,
which are basically there just for experimentation. More to come!
